## Docker One-click deployment (recommended üèÜ)
- `TOKEN`is a bot token.
- `CHANNEL` can be the channel address or chatId (can be obtained through the robot [@getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot)). If it is a channel, you need to make the channel public, pull the robot into the channel, and set it as an administrator. The channel address format is such as: `@yohannChannl`. Reference the file and reply to `get` to get the file id (base64 encoding). The file can be downloaded directly through `domain name`+`/d/`+`file id`. If it is a picture, it can be viewed directly.

Pull the personal registry image and start the container:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
--name netdisc \
-e TOKEN=xxx \
-e CHANNEL=xxx \
-e MODE=pan \
yohannfan/yohann-netdisc:1.0
```

## The binary executable starts
```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx
```

Replace xxxx with your bot token and @xxxx with the channel address or personal ID (for personal IDs, only use numbers without @).

To customize the port, use the -port parameter, for example:

```
-port 8888
```

If you don't need the homepage and only want the API and image display page, use the -index parameter, like this:

```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx -port 8888 -index
```

To enable password protection, use the -pass parameter, for example, to set the password as csznet:

```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx -port 8888 -pass csznet
```

For cloud storage mode, use the -mode pan parameter, like this:

```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx -port 8888 -mode pan
```
